# Double M Studios
Hosting a site for [DMS](www.doublemstudios.com)

After much back in forth in my brain, I’ve ultimately decided to take it upon myself to own the design language of the studio’s website. I was fed up with my previous subpar work. 

I plan on eventually turning this into a React website but for now, static it is. Static sites make it annoying to update because you have to remember to update the same component on each page.
